# Lung Cancer Detection Project

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model for lung cancer detection based on various risk factors and symptoms. The model analyzes patient data to predict the likelihood of lung cancer presence.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features related to lung cancer risk factors and symptoms, including:
- Gender
- Age
- Smoking habits
- Yellow fingers
- Anxiety levels
- Peer pressure
- Chronic diseases
- Fatigue
- Allergies
- Wheezing
- Alcohol consumption
- And other relevant health indicators

## Project Structure
- `detector.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis and model implementation
- `survey lung cancer.csv`: Dataset containing patient records and symptoms

## Credits
This project is based on the Kaggle notebook ["Lung Cancer Detection"](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ihabsherbiny/lung-cancer-detection) by **Ihab Sherbiny**.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Open and run the `detector.ipynb` notebook
4. Follow the step-by-step analysis and model implementation
